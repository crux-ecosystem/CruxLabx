				<p>
					CruxLabx is a frontier R&D venture dedicated to <span className="font-semibold text-primary">engineering intelligence from within</span>. We build self-contained, emotionally intelligent AI systems that thrive in local environments—offline, secure, and deeply adaptive.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Born from student innovation and field research, CruxLabx blends rigorous engineering with cultural sensitivity to create tools like IntraMind—modular AI infrastructure designed for organizations, campuses, and communities. Our systems respect boundaries, preserve privacy, and evolve with context.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					We believe intelligence isn't just about data—it's about <span className="font-semibold">empathy, memory, and purpose</span>. Whether it's powering grassroots research, enabling secure collaboration, or bridging ancient wisdom with modern tech, CruxLabx is committed to shaping AI that feels human, thinks locally, and scales globally.
